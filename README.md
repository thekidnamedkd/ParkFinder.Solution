## Specifications/Example Queries


Example Query:



## Software/Installation Requirements
* Install [Git v2.62.2+](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)
* Install [.NET version 3.1 SDK v2.2+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)
* Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Install [MySql Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)


## Setup

Copy this url to clone this project to your local system using computer's Command Line terminal: 
```https://github.com/tayphill13/ParkFinder.Solution.git```

If you wish to edit the code base: Open the project in your code editor; with Bash, this is done by navigating to the project directory `cd ParkFinder.Solution`, then `code .`


## Database Setup/Migration

* Run MySQL by entering ```mysql -uroot -pepicodus``` in the terminal (In this example, 'epicodus' is the password, so if the word `password` was your password then you'd have ```msql -uroot -ppassword```)

* If you are using mysql workbench then the database can be generated by importing `park_finder.sql` located in the `ParkFinder.Solution` directory.
* This can be found in the MySql Workbench `Server` menu as `Data Import`, then choose `Import from Self-Contained File`.  Use the browsing tool to select the `park_finder.sql` file that is included with the project and finally select `Start Import`.


* Within the project file, `appsettings.json` you will need to be sure that the password (pwd) matches the password that you are using for your MySql Workbench.
* Your appsettings.json file should follow this format:

  ```
  ...
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=park_finder;uid=<USER>;pwd=<PASSWORD>;"
  }
  ...
  ```

#### Alternatively,
* In your command line terminal, type `cd Desktop` then navigate to project folder using `cd ParkFinder.Solution`
* Then navigate to `cd TravelApi` and type ``` dotnet ef migrations Initial ```
* Then type ``` dotnet ef database update ```
* You can confirm your the database has been created by going to the `Schemas` tab in your MySql Workbench and then right click and select `Refresh All` in the schema window.

### Running the program:
1. In your command line terminal, type `cd Desktop` then navigate to project folder using `cd ParkFinder.Solution`
2. To run the program, you'll need navigate to the project folder by entering `cd Parks`, then to compile the code enter: `dotnet restore`. This will create a compiled application in the bin/ folder.  Do not touch the files in the bin/ or obj/ folders, you will not need to and the application will not run as intended.
3. You can then run the program directly with `dotnet run` while still within the TravelApi directory.
